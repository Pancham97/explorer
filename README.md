# Explorer app

I wanted to build an app that lets me put my thoughts, ideas, documents, images, videos, links, everything that I can think of at one place. I found the alternatives expensive and I wanted something that I could call my own while adding / removing features that I think I need / do not think add value to the product.

Presenting Explorer. Add anything. Explore!
